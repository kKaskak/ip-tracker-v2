# ip-tracker-v2
 Image IP tracker written in JavaScript using express
## The idea is simple: 
 1. Send an email containing a white invisible image to the scammer / attacker 
 2. Instantly get back his IP address when he opens the email

## How to?
 1. Clone this repo. 
 2. Set up a free web service (I used Render).
 3. Connect the web service to your repo.
 4. Deploy.
 5. Go to https://your_domain.onrender.com/image
 6. You got the IP in the logs.
 7. Send an email containing this image.
